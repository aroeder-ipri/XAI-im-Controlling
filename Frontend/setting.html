    <h1>Setting</h1>
    <p>Imagine you are the manager of a convenience store which is part of a store chain called AStore.
Once a year all store managers set a sales target for their store for the upcoming year and report them to their supervisor. Depending on the target difficulty and the sales performance, store managers receive an additional bonus at the end of the year.
To make an informed decision on the target difficulty, store managers receive a sales forecast provided by an artificial intelligence (AI) which has shown decent forecasting accuracy in previous years.
After answering some general questions on the following pages, you will be forwarded to the AI-forecast. You can interact with the site and inform yourself about the AI prediction. Make sure to read all information to make an informed decision on a reasonable sales target of your store.
Upon return to this site, you will be asked for the sales target which has a direct influence on your payment. Your can earn up to $1 for setting difficult, yet accurate goals for your store. However, if you miss your target, there will be no bonus payment. Your bonus payment increases by $0.04 for every 100 units of sales. The bonus payment dependent on the goal you set for your store is described in the blue line in the graph below.
If you feel unsure about your decision or if you want additional information, you can always ask your supervisor for advice. With his expertise and experience he can make a very accurate guess about future sales providing you with another forecast of future sales which is very close to the actual sales.  However, for the time and effort required to help you, your supervisor will reduce your bonus payment. Hence, your bonus will be reduced by $0.20 if you ask your supervisor for advice. Your bonus payment dependent on the goal you set after asking for advice is depicted in the gray line in the graph below.
